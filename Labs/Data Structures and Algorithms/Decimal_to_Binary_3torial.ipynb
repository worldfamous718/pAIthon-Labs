    "1. **Define first function for 3torial methods**: Accepts the decimal we need to convert as an argument.\n",
    "2. **If the number is zero**: No calculation needed; Return value as zero.\n",
    "3. **Create empty string named 'binary'**: To store the bits; This will end up being our result in binary.\n",
    "4. **Use a while loop**: To control the successive division; The loop will end when division reaches zero.\n",
    "5. **Use modulo**: To determine if dividing the decimal (n) by 2 leaves a remainder of 0 or 1. The result is converted to a string ('0' or '1') and prepended to the binary string.\n",
    "6. **Divide by 2**: This will start shifting the bits into place. Using floor division (//) allows us to successively divide only the integer part of the decimal.\n",
    "7. **Print statement**: Can be uncommented by removing the '#'; Run code and follow the iterations. Let's walk through this process for the number 75:\n",
    "    - Initially, n = 75, result = ''\n",
    "    - Iteration 1: n % 2 = 1, result = '1', n = 75 // 2 = 37\n",
    "    - Iteration 2: n % 2 = 1, result = '11', n = 37 // 2 = 18\n",
    "    - Iteration 3: n % 2 = 0, result = '011', n = 18 // 2 = 9\n",
    "    - ... (continues until n = 0)\n",
    "    - Final result = '1001011'\n",
    "    - Be sure to delete the print statement after testing; or replace the '#' to comment it out.\n",
    "8. **Final result**: Will be our decimal number converted to binary value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allows us to use basic Python3 functionality to mimic successive division for converting decimal numbers to binary.\n"
