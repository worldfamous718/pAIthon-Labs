    "\n",
    "<h3>Problem Statement</h3>\n",
    "<p>Imagine you're organizing a social event for a group of friends. You have two lists: one containing the names of the boys attending and another containing the names of the girls. Your task is to write a Python3 program that greets each boy and his corresponding girl, if available, in a specific format.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Desired Outcome</h3>\n",
    "<p><span><code>boys = ['Bob', 'Phil', 'Jack', 'Peter']</code/></span></p>\n",

    "<pre><code>Hello Peter, and Lara</pre></code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>\n",
    "<p>By the end of this 3torial, you should be able to:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Understand how to work with multiple lists in Python3</li>\n",
    "    <li>Implement efficient looping structures</li>\n",
    "    <li>Use the<span><code>zip()</code></span>function to iterate over multiple lists simultaneously</li>\n",
    "    <li>Handle cases where lists might have different lengths</li>\n",
    "    <li>Write clean and readable Python code</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>1. Introduction to Lists in Python3</h3>\n",
    "<p>Lists are one of the most fundamental data structures in Python. They allow you to store collections of items in a single variable. Think of a list like a shopping cart â€“ you can add multiple items to it, remove items, and rearrange them easily.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Key Points About Lists:</h3>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Lists are denoted by square brackets [ ]</li>\n",
    "    <li>Items in a list are separated by commas</li>\n",
    "    <li>Lists can contain any type of object, including numbers, strings, other lists etc.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<h3>Basic Syntax:</h3>\n",
    "<span><code>my_list = [item1, item2, item3]</code></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Common Operations:</h3>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Accessing elements: \n",
    "     <span><code>my_list[0]</code></span></li>\n",
    "    <li>Adding elements:\n",
    "    <span><code>my_list.append(new_item)</code></span></li>\n",
    "    <li>Removing elements:\n",
    "    <span><code>my_list.remove(item_to_remove)</code></span></li>\n",
    "    <li>Getting the number of elements:\n",
    "    <span><code>len(my_list)</code></span></li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "<h3>Creating Our Lists</h3>\n",
    "<p>Remember that lists are denoted by square brackets.</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>boys = []</pre></code>\n",
    "<pre><code>girls = []</pre></code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Now we have an empty list for boys as well as one for girls. Empty brackets denote empty list.</p>\n",
    "<p>Allow us to add people to our list</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Direct Assignment:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>boys = []</pre></code>\n",
    "<pre><code>boys = boys + ['Bob', 'Phil', 'Jack', 'Peter']</pre></code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Using append():</h3>\n",
    "<pre><code>girls = []</code></pre>\n",
    "<pre><code>girls.append('Janet')</code></pre>\n",
    "<pre><code>girls.append('Theresa')</code></pre>\n",
    "<pre><code>girls.append('Jeannette')</code></pre>\n",
    "<pre><code>girls.append('Lara')</pre></code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Now enter the following command onto the console</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>print(boys)</pre></code>\n",
    "<pre><code>print(girls)</pre></code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Accessing List Elements:</h3>\n",
    "<p>Congratulations! We have our lists created. </p>\n",
    "<p>Supposing now I wanted to access a specific name from the boys list. How could I approach that?</p>\n",
    "<p>In Python3, list items are called 'elements'. Elements reside at specific 'indices' on lists.</p>\n",
    "<p>Take our boys list for example:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>['Bob', 'Phil', 'Jack', 'Peter']</pre></code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>As we can see, there are 4 names in the list. Bob, Phil, Jack, and Peter. In Python3 we would say, there are 4 elements in the boys list</p>\n",
    "<p>Lists, as well as several other data types in Python3 are, what we call, 'zero indexed'. Meaning, simply that they begin with zero.</p>\n",
    "<p>Knowing that, we can now say that Bob resides at index 0 in the list. Peter would reside at index 3.</p>\n",
    "<p>So, to be clear. In our boys list, we can also say we have</p><span><code>[0], [1], [2], and [3]</span></code> To the computer, thats the same as calling the names Bob, Phil, Jack, and Peter.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The proper syntax to access Jack from the list would be:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>boys[2]</pre></code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Using Slice:</h3>\n",
    "<p>The slice method in Python3 is a powerful way to extract portions of sequences such as lists, tuples, or strings. It allows you to select a subset of elements from a collection without modifying the original data.</p>\n",
    "<p>Syntax:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>sequence[start:end:step]</pre></code>\n",
    "<p>Where:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><span><code>start</code></span>:The starting index(optional,default is 0)</li>\n",
    "    <li><span><code>end</code></span>:The ending index(optional, default is the length of the sequence)</li>\n",
    "    <li><span><code>step</code></span>:The increment between elements (optional, default is 1)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<h3>Example 1: Basic Slicing</h3>\n",
    "<pre><code>boys = ['Bob', 'Phil', 'Jack', 'Peter]</pre></code>\n",
    "<p><span><code>print(boys[1:])</code></span> # Output ['Phil, 'Jack', 'Peter']</p>\n",
    "<p><span><code>print(boys[:3]</code></span> # Output ['Bob, 'Phil', 'Jack'])</p>\n",
    "<p>Explantion:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><span><code>boys[1:]</code></span> starts from index 1 and goes to the end</li>\n",
    "    <li><span><code>boys[:3]</code></span> starts from the beginning up to index 3 (exclusive)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Example 2: Specifying Start to End</h3>\n",
    "<p><span><code>print(boys[1:3])</code></span> # Output: ['Phil', 'Jack']</p>\n",
    "<p><span><code>print(boys[1:4:2])</code></span> # Output: ['Phil', 'Peter']</p>\n",
    "<p>Explanation:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><span><code>boys[1:3]</code></span> selects elements from index 1 to 3 (exclusive)</li>\n",
    "    <li><span><code>boys[1:4:2]</code></span> selects every second element starting from index 1</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Example 3: Negative Indexing</h3>\n",
    "<p><span><code>print(boys[-2:]</code></span> # Output: ['Jack', 'Peter'])</p>\n",
    "<p><span><code>print(boys[:-1])</code></span> # Output ['Bob', 'Phil', 'Jack']</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Explanation:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><span><code>boys[-2:]</code></span>selects the last two elements</li>\n",
    "    <li><span><code>boys[:-1]</code></span>selects all elements except the last one</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Key Points to Remember</h3>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Omitting the start index means the slice starts from the beginning of the sequence.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Omitting the end index means the slice goes to the end of the sequence.</li>\n",
    "    <li>A negative step value reverses the order of the selected elements.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The slice method returns a new list; it doesn't modify the original sequence.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Both<span><code>start</span></code>and<span><code>end</code></span>are exclusive. This means the slice includes all elements up to but not including the<span><code>end</code></span>index</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Ok, we have more information about lists. Perhaps now we can look further into solving our problem set. We need a Python3 program that will greet each boy and girl pair from the the list we just created.</p>\n",
    "<p>From what we have seen so far in this 3torial. There is a print function in Python3 that allows us to print things to the console</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Print Function:</h3>\n",
    "<p>The<span><code>print</code></span>function in Python is used to output text or values to the console or standard output stream. It's one of the most commonly used functions in Python for displaying information to the user or for debugging purposes.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Syntax:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>print('statement')</pre></code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Let's try using what we have learned to print the first name from boys list and the girls list.</p>\n",
    "<p><span><code>print(boys[0])</code></span> # Output Bob</p>\n",
    "<p><span><code>print(girls[0])</code></span> # Output Janet</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Now see if you can add 'Hello' and the name from the list</p>\n",
    "<p><span><code>print(f'Hello, {boys[0]'})</code></span> # Output Hello, Bob</p>\n",
    "<p><span><code>print(f'Hello, {girls[0]'})</code></span> # Output Hello, Janet</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Great! We are moving right along nicely.</p>\n",
    "<p>Before we can attempt to put this all together, I'd like to introduce two more concepts that work well when dealing with lists in Python3.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>The len() Function:</h3>\n",
    "<p>The<span><code>len()</code></span>function in Python returns the number of items in an object. For lists, it returns the total count of elements.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Syntax</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>len(list_name)</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Basic usage</h3>\n",
    "<p>The simplest use of<span><code>len</code></span>is to get the number of elements in a list:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>books = ['Python', 'Sql', 'java']</pre></code>\n",
    "<pre><code>number_of_books = len(books)</pre></code>\n",
    "<p><pre><code>print(number_of_books)</pre</code> #  Output: 3</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Using range():</h3>\n",
    "<p>The<span><code>range</code></span>function in Python3 generates a sequence of integers. It's commonly used in loops to iterate over a series of numbers, especially when working with lists or other sequences.</p>\n",
    "<p>Its syntax and fuctionality is quite similar to slicing.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Syntax:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>range([start], stop[, step])</pre></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Where:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><span><code>start</code></span>: Starting number(optional, default is 0)</li>\n",
    "    <li><span><code>stop</code></span>: Ending number (exclusive)</li>\n",
    "    <li><span><code>step</code></span>: Difference between each number (optional, default is 1)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In order for us to have a better understanding of how we would implement<span><code>len()</code></span>, and <span><code>range</code></span>for our problem set, it's only fair that we have a general overview of a concept in Python3 known as 'looping'</p>\n",
    "<p>There are several ways Python3 handles looping. We will focus on the 'for loop'</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>For Loops in Python3</h3>\n",
    "<p>A 'for loop' in Python is a control flow statement that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times. It's one of the most common and versatile ways to perform repetitive tasks in Python.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Syntax:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>for variable in iterable:</pre></code>\n",
    "    <p>#   code to be executed</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Where:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><span><code>variable</code></span>is the temporary variable that takes on the value of each item in the iterable</li>\n",
    "    <li><span><code>iterable</code></span>is any sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable object</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Basic Usage with range()</h3>\n",
    "<pre><code>for i in range(3):</pre></code>\n",
    "<p>      # print(i)</p>\n",
    "<p>Output:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>0</pre></code>\n",
    "<pre><code>1</pre></code>\n",
    "<pre><code>2</pre></code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Iterating Over a List:</h3>\n",
    "<pre><span>drinks = ['cheerwine', 'coke', 'pepsi']</pre></code>\n",
    "<pre><code>for drink in drinks:</pre></code>\n",
    "<p>            #print(drink)</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Output:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>cheerwine</pre></code>\n",
    "<pre><code>coke</pre></code>\n",
    "<pre><code>pepsi</pre></code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This outputs each drink in our list</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Combining len() and range()</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "    for person2 in group2:\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello {person1} and {person2}!\")\n",
    "</code></pre> \n",
    "<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n",

    "Hello Alice and David!\n",
    "Hello Bob and Charlie!\n",
    "Hello Bob and David!\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>2. Modified Approach Using a Single Loop with Indices</h2>\n",
    "<p>In this approach, we use the <code>range()</code> and <code>len()</code> functions to iterate through the lists based on their indices. This ensures that we greet corresponding members from both lists.</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "# Modified approach using a single loop with indices\n",

    "<h2>3. Alternative Approach Using the zip() Function</h2>\n",
    "<p>The <code>zip()</code> function allows us to iterate over both lists simultaneously, creating pairs of names to greet.</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",

    "<pre><code>\n",
    "Hello Alice and Charlie!\n",
    "Hello Bob and David!\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>4. Handling Lists of Different Lengths</h2>\n",
    "<p>To handle cases where the lists may have different lengths, we can create a custom function that greets all members, ensuring that no one is left out.</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "# Handling lists of different lengths\n",
    "def greet_groups(group1, group2):\n",
