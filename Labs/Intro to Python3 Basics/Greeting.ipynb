    "<h1>3torial: Greeting Groups of People in Python3</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In this 3torial, we will discuss how to create a loop to greet groups of people from two separate lists, with a desired output format. We will survey three iterations of the solution:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>1. Initial Approach Using Nested Loops</h2>\n",
    "<p>This method obviously doesn't work. It is merely a representation of what a student struggling with basic Python concepts may create. Goal is to correct the code to attain the desired output.</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "# Initial approach (incorrect)\n",
    "group1 = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"]\n",
    "group2 = [\"Charlie\", \"David\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for person1 in group1:\n",
    "    for person2 in group2:\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello {person1} and {person2}!\")\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "Hello Alice and Charlie!\n",
    "Hello Alice and David!\n",
    "Hello Bob and Charlie!\n",
    "Hello Bob and David!\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>2. Modified Approach Using a Single Loop with Indices</h2>\n",
    "<p>In this approach, we use the <code>range()</code> and <code>len()</code> functions to iterate through the lists based on their indices. This ensures that we greet corresponding members from both lists.</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "# Modified approach using a single loop with indices\n",
    "group1 = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"]\n",
    "group2 = [\"Charlie\", \"David\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(len(group1)):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello {group1[i]} and {group2[i]}!\")\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "Hello Alice and Charlie!\n",
    "Hello Bob and David!\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>3. Alternative Approach Using the zip() Function</h2>\n",
    "<p>The <code>zip()</code> function allows us to iterate over both lists simultaneously, creating pairs of names to greet.</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "# Alternative approach using zip()\n",
    "group1 = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"]\n",
    "group2 = [\"Charlie\", \"David\"]\n",

    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "Hello Alice and Charlie!\n",
    "Hello Bob and David!\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>4. Handling Lists of Different Lengths</h2>\n",
    "<p>To handle cases where the lists may have different lengths, we can create a custom function that greets all members, ensuring that no one is left out.</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "# Handling lists of different lengths\n",
    "def greet_groups(group1, group2):\n",
    "    max_length = max(len(group1), len(group2))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for i in range(max_length):\n",
    "        person1 = group1[i] if i < len(group1) else \"No one from group 1\"\n",
    "        person2 = group2[i] if i < len(group2) else \"No one from group 2\"\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello {person1} and {person2}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "group1 = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"]\n",
    "group2 = [\"Charlie\", \"David\", \"Eve\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "greet_groups(group1, group2)\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "Hello Alice and Charlie!\n",
    "Hello Bob and David!\n",
    "Hello No one from group 1 and Eve!\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Key Points Covered</h2>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Basic Python Functionality</strong>: We explored loops, list indexing, and the <code>zip()</code> function.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Relationships Between Lists</strong>: We demonstrated how to work with multiple lists and their relationships.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Handling Different Lengths</strong>: We created a custom function to ensure all members are greeted, regardless of list length.</li>\n",
